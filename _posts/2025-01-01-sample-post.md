This is a demo post showing how to add code blocks, images with captions, and LaTeX math.

Here is a Python snippet:

```python
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("world"))
```

You can drop in an image with a caption like this:

Inline math works with single dollars, e.g. $E=mc^2$.

Display math works with double dollars:

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$
